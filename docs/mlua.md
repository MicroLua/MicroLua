# `mlua.*` modules

This page describes the modules specific to MicroLua.

The test modules can be useful as usage examples.

## Globals

- `_VERSION: string = LUA_VERSION`\
  `_RELEASE: string = LUA_RELEASE`

- `WeakK: table = {__mode = 'k'}`\
  A metatable for weak keys.

- `arg: table`\
  The arguments passed to `main()`. The table is zero-based: `arg[0]` contains
  the executable name, and the following indexes contain the command-line
  arguments. The global isn't set when running on a target that doesn't have
  command-line arguments.

- `module(name)`\
  Create a new empty module.

- `try(fn, [arg, ...]) -> (results) | (fail, err)`\
  Call `fn` with the given arguments, and return the results of the call. If the
  call raises an error, return `fail` and the error that was raised. This
  function is kind of the opposite of `assert()`: it transforms errors into
  `(fail, err)`, whereas `assert()` transforms `(fail, err)` into errors.

  `try()` is slightly more convenient than `pcall()` when the first result is
  known to not be `nil`, as it doesn't insert the status code. For example, to
  require a module that may not be present:

  ```lua
  local i2c = try(require, 'hardware.i2c')
  if i2c then ... end
  ```

- `equal(a, b) -> boolean`\
  Return the result of comparing `a` and `b` for equality. Unlike the `==`
  operator, this function always calls the `__eq` metamethod of either argument
  if it exists, even if the arguments have different types.

- `pointer(address) -> pointer`\
  Return a [pointer](core.md#pointers) to the given address.

- `alloc_stats(reset = false) -> (count, size, used, peak)`\
  Return statistics about Lua memory allocations. `count` is the number of
  memory allocations performed. `size` is the total amount of memory allocated.
  `used` is the amount of memory currently allocated. `peak` is the maximum
  amount of memory allocated since the last time it was reset. When `reset` is
  `true`, `peak` is reset after returning its current value. Allocation
  statistics must be enabled by setting the `MLUA_ALLOC_STATS` compile
  definition to `1`. When disabled, all return values are `nil`.

- `with_traceback(fn) -> function`\
  Wrap a function to convert raised errors to string and add a traceback. Return
  values are forwarded unchanged.

- `log_error(fn, stream = _G.stderr) -> function`\
  Wrap a function to log a raised error with a traceback to an output stream.
  Return values and errors are forwarded unchanged. This is useful to wrap
  functions whose errors are otherwise silently dropped, e.g. thread functions.

## `mlua.bits`

**Module:** [`mlua.bits`](../lib/common/mlua.bits.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.bits`

This module provides bit operations on integers. It supports both `integer` and
`Int64` values.

- `leading_zeros(value) -> integer`\
  Return the number of leading zero bits of `value`.

- `trailing_zeros(value) -> integer`\
  Return the number of trailing zero bits of `value`.

- `mask(count) -> integer | Int64`\
  Return a bit mask with `count` least significant bits set.

## `mlua.block`

**Module:** [`mlua.block`](../lib/common/mlua.block.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.block`

This module provides an abstraction for defining block devices in C
(`mlua.block.Dev`). Functions that fail return `fail`, an error message and an
error code from [`mlua.errors`](#mluaerrors).

- `Dev:read(offset, size) -> string | (fail, msg, err)`\
  Read from the block device. `offset` and `size` must be multiples of
  `read_size`.

- `Dev:write(offset, data) -> true | (fail, msg, err)`\
  Write to the block device. `offset` and `size` must be multiples of
  `write_size`.

- `Dev:erase(offset, size) -> true | (fail, msg, err)`\
  Erase a range of the block device. `offset` and `size` must be multiples of
  `erase_size`.

- `Dev:sync() -> true | (fail, msg, err)`\
  Flush all writes to the block device.

- `Dev:size() -> (integer, integer, integer, integer)`\
  Return the size of the block device in bytes, as well as `read_size`,
  `write_size` and `erase_size`.

## `mlua.block.flash`

**Module:** [`mlua.block.flash`](../lib/pico/mlua.block.flash.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.block.flash`

This module provides a block device that uses the QSPI flash for storage.

- `new(offset, size) -> Dev`\
  Create a new flash block device starting at `offset` in flash memory. `offset`
  is rounded up to the next multiple of `FLASH_SECTOR_SIZE`. `size` is adjusted so that `offset + size` is rounded down to the previous multiple of
  `FLASH_SECTOR_SIZE`.

## `mlua.block.mem`

**Module:** [`mlua.block.mem`](../lib/common/mlua.block.mem.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.block.mem`

This module provides a block device that uses a
[raw buffer](core.md#buffer-protocol) for storage, i.e. a contiguous block of
RAM.

- `new(buffer, size, write_size = 256, erase_size = 256) -> Dev`\
  Create a new memory block device in `buffer`.

## `mlua.config`

**Module:** `mlua.config` (auto-generated),
tests: [`mlua.config.test`](../lib/common/mlua.config.test.lua)

This module is auto-generated for all executables defined with
`mlua_add_executable()`, and contains the symbols defined by
`mlua_target_config()` calls. Symbol definitions have the format
`{name}:{type}={value}`, where `{type}` is one of `boolean`, `integer`, `number`
or `string`.

**Example:**

```cmake
mlua_add_executable(example_executable)
mlua_target_config(example_executable
    my_bool:boolean=true
    my_int:integer=42
    my_num:number=123.456
    my_str:string=\"some-string\"
)
```

## `mlua.errors`

build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.errors`,
tests: [`mlua.errors.test`](../lib/common/mlua.errors.test.lua)

This module provides a common set of error codes, for use by other modules. Note
that although the error codes look very much like `errno` values, they have
nothing to do with `errno` and have different numeric values.

- `message(code) -> string`\
  Return a string describing the given error code.

## `mlua.fs`

**Module:** [`mlua.fs`](../lib/common/mlua.fs.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.fs`,

## `mlua.fs.lfs`

**Module:** [`mlua.fs.lfs`](../lib/common/mlua.fs.lfs.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.fs.lfs`,
tests: [`mlua.fs.lfs.test`](../lib/common/mlua.fs.lfs.test.lua)

This module provides bindings for the
[littlefs](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) library. It allows
creating and mounting filesystems on [block devices](#mluablock) and operating
on their content. The following compile definitions affect how the bindings are
exposed:

- `LFS_READONLY`: When defined, allow only read operations.
- `LFS_MIGRATE`: When defined, provide the `Filesystem:migrate()` function.
- `LFS_THREADSAFE`: When defined, enables locking on filesystems, allowing
  access from both cores.

Functions that fail return `fail`, an error message and an error code from
[`mlua.errors`](#mluaerrors).

- `VERSION: integer`\
  `DISK_VERSION: integer`\
  The library and disk format versions.

- `NAME_MAX: integer`\
  `FILE_MAX: integer`\
  `ATTR_MAX: integer`\
  The maximum size of file names, file content and custom attributes.

- `new(device) -> Filesystem`\
  Create a filesystem object operating on the given block device. This doesn't
  format or mount the filesystem; it only binds a filesystem to a device.

### `Filesystem`

The `Filesystem` type (`mlua.fs.lfs.Filesystem`) represents a filesystem.

- `Filesystem:format(size) -> true | (fail, msg, err)`\
  Format the underlying block device for a filesystem of the given size. If
  `size` is missing, the filesystem fills the whole block device. The filesystem
  must not be mounted.

  Grow a mounted filesystem to the given size. If `size` is missing, the
  filesystem is grown to fill the whole block device.

- `Filesystem:statvfs() -> (6 * integer) | (fail, msg, err)`\
  Return information about the filesystem, as described by `struct lfs_fsinfo`:
  the on-disk version (`disk_version`), the size of a logical block
  (`block_size`), the number of logical blocks (`block_count`), and the limits
  on file names (`name_max`), file content (`file_max`) and custom attributes
  (`attr_max`).

  Attempt to migrate a previous version of littlefs. If `size` is missing, the
  filesystem fills the whole block device. The filesystem must not be mounted.
  Only defined if `LFS_MIGRATE` is defined.

- `Filesystem:open(path, flags) -> File | (fail, msg, err)`\
  Open a file. `flags` is a bitwise-or of `fs.O_*` values.

- `Filesystem:list(path) -> iter(name, type, [size]) | (fail, msg, err)`\

  Change the current position in the file. Returns the new position from the
  start of the file.

- `File:rewind() -> integer | (fail, msg, err)`\
  Change the current position to the start of the file (equivalent to
  `seek(0, SEEK_SET)`). Returns the new position from the start of the file (0).

- `File:tell() -> integer | (fail, msg, err)`\
  Return the current position in the file (equivalent to `seek(0, SEEK_CUR)`).

- `File:size() -> integer | (fail, msg, err)`\

## `mlua.fs.loader`

**Module:** [`mlua.fs.loader`](../lib/pico/mlua.fs.loader.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.fs.loader`,
tests: [`mlua.fs.loader.test`](../lib/pico/mlua.fs.loader.test.lua)

This module creates a global filesystem early in the boot process, and registers
a module searcher that looks up modules in that filesystem. When the module is
linked-in, it is auto-loaded during interpreter creation, which enables loading
the main module from the filesystem, for both cores.

The filesystem is mounted as littlefs ([`mlua.fs.lfs`](#mluafslfs)) and uses the
QSPI flash for storage ([`mlua.block.flash`](#mluablockflash)). It can be
customized with the following compile definitions:

- `MLUA_FS_LOADER_OFFSET` (default: `PICO_FLASH_SIZE_BYTES -
  MLUA_FS_LOADER_SIZE`): The offset in flash memory where the filesystem starts.
  Must be aligned on a `FLASH_SECTOR_SIZE` boundary. The default value places it
  at the end of the flash memory.
- `MLUA_FS_LOADER_SIZE` (default: 1 MiB): The size of the filesystem. Must be a
  multiple of `FLASH_SECTOR_SIZE`.
- `MLUA_FS_LOADER_BASE` (default: `"/lua"`): The path below which to look for
  modules.
- `MLUA_FS_LOADER_FLAT` (default: 1): When true, look up modules in the
  directory `MLUA_FS_LOADER_BASE`, i.e. the module `a.b.c` is loaded from the
  file `/lua/a.b.c.lua`. When false, look up modules in `MLUA_FS_LOADER_BASE`
  and its subdirectories, i.e. the module `a.b.c` is loaded either from
  `/lua/a/b/c.lua` or `/lua/a/b/c/init.lua`.

Information about the filesystem (flash range, type) is available as binary
info, and can be viewed with `picotool info -a`.

- `block: mlua.block.Dev`\
  The block device on which the filesystem operates.

- `fs: mlua.fs.lfs.Filesystem`\
  The filesystem from which modules are loaded.

## `mlua.int64`

**Module:** [`mlua.int64`](../lib/common/mlua.int64.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.int64`,
tests: [`mlua.int64.test`](../lib/common/mlua.int64.test.lua)

This module provides a 64-bit signed integer type (`mlua.Int64`). When
`lua_Integer` is a 32-bit integer, `Int64` is a full userdata with all the
relevant metamethods, supporting mixed-type operations with `integer` (but no
automatic promotion to `number`). When `lua_Integer` is a 64-bit integer,
`Int64` is an alias for `integer`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mixed-type equality comparisons (`==`, `~=`) involving `Int64` values do not
> work correctly**, because Lua only calls the `__eq` metamethod if the values
> are either both tables or both full userdata. Use `_G.equal()` instead if
> either argument may be a primitive type.

- `int64(value) -> Int64 | nil`\
  Cast `value` to an `Int64`. `value` can have the following types:

  - `boolean`: `false -> 0`, `true -> 1`
  - `integer`: Sign-extends `value` to an `Int64`. When `lua_Integer` is a
    32-bit integer, an optional second argument provides the high-order 32 bits.
  - `number`: Fails if `value` cannot be represented exactly as an `Int64`.
  - `string`: Parse the value from a string. Accepts an optional `base` argument
    (default: 0). When the base is 0, it is inferred from the value prefix
    (`0x`, `0X`: 16, `0o`: 8, `0b`: 2, otherwise: 10).

- `min: Int64 = -2^63`\
  `max: Int64 = 2^63-1`\
  The minimum and maximum values that an `Int64` can hold.

- `ashr(value, num) -> Int64`\
  Returns the result of performing an arithmetic (i.e. sign-extending) right
  shift of `value` by `num` bits.

- `hex(value) -> string`\
  Return a hexadecimal representation of `value`.

- `tointeger(value) -> integer | nil`\
  Convert `value` to an `integer`. Fails if `value` cannot be represented
  exactly as an `integer`.

- `tonumber(value) -> number | nil`\
  Convert `value` to a `number`. Fails if `value` cannot be represented exactly
  as a `number`.

- `ult(lhs, rhs) -> boolean`\
  Return true iff `lhs` is less than `rhs` when they are compared as unsigned
  64-bit integers.

## `mlua.io`

**Module:** [`mlua.io`](../lib/common/mlua.io.lua),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.io`,
tests: [`mlua.io.test`](../lib/common/mlua.io.test.lua)

This module provides helpers for input / output processing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Output functions block without yielding if the output buffer for `stdout` is
> full.

- `read(count) -> string | nil`\
  Read at least one and at most `count` characters from `stdin`. Uses
  [`pico.stdio`](pico.md#picostdio) if the module is available, or blocks
  without yielding if no data is available.

- `write(data) -> integer | nil`\
  Write data to `stdout`, and return the number of characters written.

- `printf(format, ...) -> integer | nil`\
  Format the arguments with `string:format()` and write the result to `stdout`.

- `fprintf(out, format, ...) -> integer | nil`\
  Format the arguments with `string:format()` and write the result to `out`.

- `ansi_tags: table`\
  `empty_tags: function`\
  Sets of tags that subtitute with ANSI escape codes and empty strings,
  respectively.

- `ansi(s, [tags]) -> string`\
  Substitute tags of the form `@{...}` with the corresponding ANSI escape codes.
  See the module source for supported tags.

- `aformat(format, ...) -> string`\
  Substitute tags in `format`, then format the arguments with `string:format()`.

- `aprintf(format, ...) -> integer | nil`\
  Substitute tags in `format`, format the arguments with `string:format()` and
  output the result to `stdout`.

- `afprintf(out, format, ...) -> integer | nil`\
  Substitute tags in `format`, format the arguments with `string:format()` and
  output the result to `out`.

- `read_all(reader, len, ...) -> string | nil`\
  Read exactly `len` bytes from `reader`. May return fewer bytes than `len` if
  the reader reaches the end of the stream. The extra arguments are forwarded
  to each individual `read()` call.

- `read_line(reader, ...) -> string | nil`\
  Read one newline-terminated line from `reader`. May return an unterminated
  line if the reader reaches the end of the stream. The extra arguments are
  forwarded to each individual `read()` call. Note that this function is
  inefficient, because it reads one character at a time.

### `Recorder`

The `Recorder` type records writes and allows replaying them on another stream.

- `Recorder() -> Recorder`\
  Create a new `Recorder`.

- `Recorder:is_empty() -> boolean`\
  Return true iff the recorder holds no data.

- `Recorder:write(...)`\
  Write data to the recorder.

- `Recorder:replay(w)`\
  Replay the recorded writes to `w`.

- `tostring(Recorder) -> string`\
  Return the content of the recorder as a string.

### `Indenter`

The `Indenter` type is a wrapper writer that indents written lines, except empty
ones.

- `Indenter(writer, indent) -> Indenter`\
  Create an `Indenter` that writes to `writer` and indents with the string
  `indent`.

- `Indenter:write(...)`\
  Write data to the indenter.

## `mlua.list`

**Module:** [`mlua.list`](../lib/common/mlua.list.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.list`,
tests: [`mlua.list.test`](../lib/common/mlua.list.test.lua)

This module provides functions to operate on lists that can contain `nil`
values. Such lists track the length of the list explicitly in the attribute `n`.
The module itself is a metatable (`mlua.List`) that can be set on tables to
expose the functions as methods.

- `list(list) -> List`\
  Convert `list` to a `List` by setting its length in the attribute `n` and its
  metatable. If `list` is nil or missing, return an empty `List`.

- `len(list, [new]) -> integer`\
  `__len(list) -> integer`\
  Return the number of elements in `list`. If `new` is provided, set the length
  of `list` in the attribute `n`, and remove all elements at indexes `>new`. The
  old length of the list is returned.

- `eq(lhs, rhs) -> boolean`\
  `__eq(lhs, rhs) -> boolean`\
  Return true iff the elements of `lhs` and `rhs` compare pairwise equal.

- `ipairs(list) -> iterator`\
  Return an iterator over the elements of `list`.

- `append(list, value, ...) -> List`\
  Append one or more values to `list`, and return the resulting list. `list` can
  be `nil`, in which case the function creates a new empty list before appending
  the values.

- `insert(list, pos = #list + 1, value) -> list`\
  Insert `value` at position `pos` in `list`, shifting the following elements
  up by one position.

- `remove(list, pos = #list) -> any`\
  Remove the element at position `pos` from `list`, shifting the following
  elements down by one position, and return the removed value.

- `pack(...) -> List`\
  Return a new `List` containing the given arguments.

- `unpack(list, i = 1, j = #list) -> ...`\
  Return the elements at positions `i` to `j` in `list`.

- `sort(list, [cmp]) -> list`\
  Sort the elements of `list` in-place, optionally using a comparison function.

- `concat(list, sep = '', i = 1, j = #list) -> string`\
  Return the concatenation of the elements of `list` at positions `i` to `j`,
  separated by `sep`.

- `find(list, value, start = 1) -> integer`\
  Return the index of the first value in `list` that compares equal to `value`,
  starting at index `start`, or `nil` if no such value is found.

## `mlua.mem`

**Module:** [`mlua.mem`](../lib/common/mlua.mem.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.mem`,
tests: [`mlua.mem.test`](../lib/common/mlua.mem.test.lua)

This module provides functionality to access the contents of objects
implementing the [buffer protocol](core.md#buffer-protocol).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This module must not be used to access hardware registers. Use the
> [`hardware.base`](hardware.md#hardwarebase) module instead.

- `read(buffer, offset = 0, len = size - offset) -> string`\
  Read a range of raw data from a buffer. `len` is required if the buffer
  doesn't have a size.

- `read_cstr(buffer, offset = 0, max_len = size - offset) -> string`\
  Read a zero-terminated string from a buffer.

- `write(buffer, data, offset = 0)`\
  Write a range of raw data to a buffer.

- `fill(buffer, value = 0, offset = 0, len = size - offset)`\
  Fill a range of raw data in a buffer. `len` is required if the buffer doesn't
  have a size.

- `find(buffer, str, offset = 0, len = size - offset) -> integer | nil`\
  Find a substring in a buffer, and return its starting offset.

- `get(buffer, offset, len = 1) -> (value, ...)`\
  Get individual bytes from a buffer or from memory.

- `set(buffer, offset, [value, ...])`\
  Set individual bytes in a buffer or in memory.

- `alloc(size) -> Buffer`\
  Allocate a memory buffer of the given size.

- `mallinfo() -> (allocated, used)`\
  Return the number of bytes allocated internally by `malloc()`, and the number
  of bytes actually used. The values correspond to the `arena` and `uordblks`
  fields of `struct mallinfo`, respectively.

### `Buffer`

The `Buffer` type (`mlua.mem.Buffer`) holds a fixed-size memory buffer.

- `#Buffer -> integer`\
  Return the size of the buffer.

- `Buffer:ptr() -> pointer`\
  Return a pointer to the start of the buffer.

- `Buffer:__buffer() -> (ptr, size)`\
  Implement the [buffer protocol](core.md#buffer-protocol).

## `mlua.oo`

**Module:** [`mlua.oo`](../lib/common/mlua.oo.lua),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.oo`,
tests: [`mlua.oo.test`](../lib/common/mlua.oo.test.lua)

This module provides a simple object model for object-oriented programming.
Classes are created with `class`, providing a name and optionally a base class.
Instances are created by calling the class, optionally with arguments. The
latter are passed to the instance initializer `__init`, if it is defined.
Metamethods can be defined on classes, and have the expected effect. They are
copied from the base class to the subclass at class creation time. This is
necessary because Lua gets metamethods using a raw access.

- `class(name, base) -> Class`\
  Create a class with the given name, optionally inheriting from `base`.

- `issubclass(cls, base) -> boolean`\
  Return true iff `cls` is a subclass of `base`.

- `isinstance(obj, cls) -> boolean`\
  Return true iff `obj` is an instance of `cls`.

## `mlua.platform`

**Module:** [`mlua.platform`](../lib/common/mlua.platform.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.platform`,
tests: [`mlua.platform.test`](../lib/common/mlua.platform.test.lua)

This module exposes platform-specific functionality under a common interface.

- `name: string`\
  The name of the platform for which the binary was built (`MLUA_PLATFORM`).

- `flash: table | false`\
  A description of the flash memory provided by the platform, or `false` if the
  platform doesn't have any flash memory. The table has the fields `ptr`,
  `size`, `write_size` and `erase_size`.

## `mlua.repr`

**Module:** [`mlua.repr`](../lib/common/mlua.repr.lua),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.repr`,
tests: [`mlua.repr.test`](../lib/common/mlua.repr.test.lua)

This module exposes a single function. In fact, the whole module *is* the
function: the value returned by `require()` can be called directly.

- `repr(v, [seen]) -> string`\
  Return a human-readable string representation of `v`. `seen` is an optional
  table whose keys are table values that have already been seen while recursing
  through the data structure. If `repr()` is called on such a value again during
  recursion, it returns `...`, thereby breaking the recursion.

### `__repr` protocol

`repr()` checks for the presence of a `__repr()` metamethod on the value, and if
it finds one, calls it.

- `V:__repr(repr, seen)`\
  `repr` is the `repr()` function itself; this makes it easier to implement
  `__repr()` methods in C, as the module doesn't need to be imported explicitly.
  `seen` is the second argument of the `repr()` call, and should be updated
  (and reverted on exit) if the method calls `repr()` and the calls could
  recurse.

## `mlua.stdio`

**Module:** [`mlua.stdio`](../lib/common/mlua.stdio.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.stdio`,
tests: [`mlua.stdio.test`](../lib/common/mlua.stdio.test.lua)

This module manages stdio input and output. When linked in, it is automatically
loaded during interpreter startup. It defines input and output stream types, and
initializes the stdio libraries as defined in the compile-time configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Output functions block without yielding** if the output buffer for the
> stream is full.

- `_G.stdin: InStream`\
  `_G.stdout: OutStream`\
  `_G.stderr: OutStream`\
  The standard input and output streams. They are set in globals when the module
  is loaded.

- `_G.print(...)`\
  Print the given arguments on `stdout`.

### `InStream`

The `InStream` type (`mlua.InStream`) represents an input stream.

- `read(count) -> string | nil` *[yields]*\
  Read at least one and at most `count` characters from the stream. Uses
  [`pico.stdio`](pico.md#picostdio) if the module is available, or blocks
  without yielding if no data is available.

### `OutStream`

The `OutStream` type (`mlua.OutStream`) represents an output stream.

- `write(data) -> integer | nil`\
  Write data to the stream, and return the number of characters written.

## `mlua.testing`

**Module:** [`mlua.testing`](../lib/common/mlua.testing.lua),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.testing`,
tests: [`mlua.testing.test`](../lib/common/mlua.testing.test.lua)

This module is a unit-testing library inspired by the Go
[`testing`](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) package. The best way to understand how
the library works is by looking at the test suite included with MicroLua.

- `main()`\
  This function can be configured as a main function to execute tests from all
  linked-in modules. Modules whose name ends with `.test` are considered test
  modules, and functions in those modules whose name starts with `test_`  are
  considered test cases.

<!-- TODO: Document ExprFactory and Expr -->

### `Test`

The `Test` class represents a single unit test.

- `name: string`\
  The name of the test.

- `Test.helper`\
  A value that can be assigned to a local variable of a test helper to skip it
  when determining the location of a test failure.

- `Test.expr: ExprFactory`\
  `Test.mexpr: ExprFactory`\
  An expression factory. `expr` uses only the first return value, while `mexpr`
  packs all return values into a [`List`](#mlualist).

- `Test:path() -> string`\
  Return a path representing the full name of the test. It is composed of the
  names of the tests in the hierarchy, separated by `/`.

- `Test:cleanup(fn)`\
  Registers the function `fn` to be called after the test completes. Cleanup
  functions are executed in the reverse order of registration.

- `Test:patch(tab, name, value) -> value`\
  Set `tab[name]` to `value`, and restore the previous value at the end of the
  test.

- `Test:once(id, fn)`\
  Call `fn` if it hasn't been called in any previous test runs, for the same
  `id` string. The call state is tracked in a global.

- `Test:repr(v) -> function`\
  Return a function that calls `util.repr(v)` when called.

- `Test:func(name, args) -> function`\
  Return a function that returns a string representation of a function call when
  called.

- `Test:printf(format, ...)`\
  Format a string and print it as part of the test output.

- `Test:log(format, ...)`\
  Format and log a message, together with the location of the log statement.
  Arguments of type `function` are called, and the return value is used for
  formatting.

- `Test:skip(format, ...)`\
  Abort the test and mark it as skipped. Arguments of type `function` are
  called, and the return value is used for formatting.

- `Test:error(format, ...)`\
  Log a test failure. The current test continues to execute. Arguments of type
  `function` are called, and the return value is used for formatting.

- `Test:fatal(format, ...)`\
  Log a test failure. The current test is aborted. Arguments of type `function`
  are called, and the return value is used for formatting.

- `Test:expect(cond, format, ...)`\
  `Test:expect(value) -> Matcher`\
  Declare a test expectation. The first form logs a test failure if `cond` is
  false. Arguments of type `function` are called, and the return value is used
  for formatting. The second form returns a `Matcher` on which further
  expectations can be declared. The current test continues to execute regardless
  of the outcome.

- `Test:assert(cond, format, ...)`\
  `Test:assert(value) -> Matcher`\
  Declare a test expectation. The first form logs a test failure if `cond` is
  false. Arguments of type `function` are called, and the return value is used
  for formatting. The second form returns a `Matcher` on which further
  expectations can be declared. If the expectation fails, the current test is
  aborted.

- `Test:context(table)`\
  Set context information. The contents of `table` are printed as `key: value`
  lines with each logged message or failure. Table values of type `function` are
  called, and the return value is used for formatting.

- `Test:failed() -> boolean`\
  Return true iff the test has failed.

- `Test:run(name, fn)`\
  Run the function `fn` as a sub-test. A new `Test` instance is provided as an
  argument.

- `Test:enable_output()`\
  Normally, test output is inhibited until a failure is logged. This function
  enables test output even if no failure has been logged.

- `Test:run_module(name, pat = '^test_')`\
  Import the module `name` and run all functions whose name matches the string
  pattern `pat` as sub-tests. Unload the module at the end of the test. If the
  module contains a function named `set_up`, it is called before the first test
  function.

- `Test:run_modules(mod_pat = '%.test$', func_pat = '^test_')`\
  Run tests from all linked-in modules whose names match the string pattern
  `mod_pat` as sub-tests.

### `Matcher`

A `Matcher` instance holds a value and allows declaring expectations against
that value.

- `Matcher:label(format, ...) -> self`\
  Set the label as which the value should be reported in test failures.

- `Matcher:func(name, ...) -> self`\
  Set the label as which the value should be reported in test failures as a
  text representation of the function `name` called with the given arguments.

- `Matcher:op(op = '=') -> self`\
  Set a label for the operation that is used to check an expectation.

- `Matcher:apply(fn) -> self`\
  Apply the function `fn` to the value, and set it as the new value.

  `Matcher:neq(want, eq = _G.equal) -> self`\
  `Matcher:lt(want) -> self`\
  `Matcher:lte(want) -> self`\
  `Matcher:gt(want) -> self`\
  `Matcher:gte(want) -> self`\
  Declare an expectation that the value is equal, not equal, less than, less
  than or equal, greater than, or greater than or equal to `want`. Equality and
  inequality comparisons accept an optional equality comparison function.

- `Matcher:eq_one_of(want, eq = _G.equal) -> self`\
  Declare an expectation that the value is equal to one of the items in the list
  `want`, using the given equality comparison function.

- `Matcher:close_to(want, eps) -> self`\
  Declare an expectation that the value is within `eps` of `want`.

- `Matcher:close_to_rel(want, fact) -> self`\
  Declare an expectation that the value is within `want * fact` of `want`.

- `Matcher:matches(want) -> self`\
  Declare an expectation that the value is a string that matches the pattern
  `want`.

- `Matcher:has(key) -> self`\
  `Matcher:not_has(key) -> self`\
  Declare an expectation that the value has or doesn't have the key `key`.

- `Matcher:raises([want])`\
  Declare an expectations that calling the value raises an error whose value
  matches the string pattern `want`, or equals `want` if it isn't a string.

## `mlua.thread`

**Module:** [`mlua.thread`](../lib/common/mlua.thread.lua),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.thread`,
tests: [`mlua.thread.test`](../lib/common/mlua.thread.test.lua)

This module provides cooperative threading functionality based on coroutines.
It sets the metaclass of the `coroutine` type to `Thread`, so coroutines are
effectively threads, and `Thread` methods can be called on coroutines. Thread
scheduling is based on an active queue and a wait list. Threads on the active
queue are run round-robin until they yield or terminate. Threads on the wait
list are resumed either explicitly or due to their deadline expiring.

When this module is linked in, the interpreter setup code creates a new thread
to run the configured main function, then runs `main()`.

- `start(fn, [name]) -> Thread`\
  Start a new thread that runs `fn()`, optionally giving it a name. Errors
  raised by `fn` are silently dropped; `_G.log_errors()` can be useful to
  make such errors more visible.

- `shutdown(result, raise = false)` *[yields]*\
  Shut down the thread scheduler. If `raise` is false, return `result` from
  `main()`. Otherwise, raise `result` in `main()`. This function yields and
  therefore never returns. During shutdown, all threads are killed and their
  resources are freed.

- `yield()` *[yields]*\
  Yield from the running thread. The thread remains in the active queue, and is
  resumed after other active threads have run and yielded.

- `suspend([time])` *[yields]*\
  Suspend the running thread. If `time` is specified, the thread is resumed at
  that [absolute time](#absolute-time) at the latest. Otherwise, it is suspended
  indefinitely.

- `running() -> Thread`\
  Return the currently-running thread.

- `blocking([enable]) -> boolean`\
  When `enable` is `true`, request blocking event processing for the running
  thread (i.e. don't yield to other threads while waiting for events). When
  `enable` is `false`, request non-blocking event processing. If `enable` isn't
  provided, don't modify the flag. Returns the previous value of the flag.

  The "blocking" flag is inherited from the running thread when starting a new
  thread.

- `main()`\
  Run the thread scheduler loop.

- `stats() -> (dispatches, waits, resumes)`\
  Return statistics about the thread scheduler. `dispatches` is the number of
  event dispatch cycles. `waits` is the number of dispatch cycles where the
  scheduler slept to wait for events. `resumes` is the number of times control
  has been given to a thread.

### `Thread`

This type represents an independent thread of execution. Threads are implemented
as coroutines, so they have to yield explicitly to allow other threads to run.
Many blocking library functions can yield when they have to wait, and their
documentation mentions it explicitly.

- `Thread.start(fn, [name]) -> Thread`\
  Start a new thread that runs `fn()`, optionally giving it a name.

- `Thread.shutdown(result)` *[yields]*\
  Shut down the thread scheduler, and return `result` from `main()`. This
  function yields and therefore never returns. During shutdown, all threads are
  killed and their resources are freed.

- `Thread:name() -> string`\
  Return the name of the thread, or a generated name if none was set.

- `Thread:is_alive() -> boolean`\
  Return true iff the thread is alive, i.e. the status of its coroutine isn't
  "dead".

- `Thread:is_waiting() -> boolean`\
  Return true iff the thread is waiting to be resumed, either by a call to
  `resume()` or by a deadline given to `suspend()`.

- `Thread:resume() -> boolean`\
  Resume the thread if it is on the wait list. Returns true iff the thread was
  on the wait list.

- `Thread:kill() -> boolean`\
  Kill the thread, and return `true` iff the thread was alive. This causes the
  coroutine to unwind the stack and close all to-be-closed variables, then
  resumes any other threads waiting in a call to `join()`.

- `Thread:join()`\
  `Thread:__close()`\
  Wait for the thread to terminate. If the thread terminates with an error, the
  function re-raises the error. If the thread is assigned to a to-be-closed
  variable, it is joined when the variable is closed.

## `mlua.thread.group`

**Module:** [`mlua.thread.group`](../lib/common/mlua.thread.group.lua),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.thread.group`

This module provides functionality to facilitate thread management. The symbols
exported by this module are automatically added to `mlua.thread`.

### `Group`

This type represents a set of threads that have a common lifetime. It allows
adding threads to the group and waiting for them to terminate. Threads that
terminate automatically get removed from the group.

- `Group() -> Group`\
  Create a new thread group.

- `Group:start(fn, [name]) -> Thread`\
  Start a new thread that runs `fn()` and add it to the group.

- `Group:join()`\
  `Group:__close()`\
  Join the threads in the group. If the group is assigned to a to-be-closed
  variable, it is joined when the variable is closed.

## `mlua.time`

**Module:** [`mlua.time`](../lib/common/mlua.time.c),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.time`,
tests: [`mlua.time.test`](../lib/common/mlua.time.test.lua)

This module provides platform-independent time functionality.

- `usec: integer = 1`\
  `msec: integer = 1000`\
  `sec: integer = 1000 * 1000`\
  `min: integer = 60 * 1000 * 1000`\
  The number of ticks counted per microsecond, millisecond, second and minute,
  respectively.

- `ticks_min: Int64`\
  `ticks_max: Int64`\
  The range of values that can be returned by `ticks64()`.

- `ticks64() -> Int64`\
  Return the current [absolute time](#absolute-time).

- `ticks() -> integer`\
  Return the low-order bits of the current [absolute time](#absolute-time) that
  fit a Lua integer.

- `to_ticks64(time, [now]) -> Int64`\
  Convert an integer [absolute time](#absolute-time) to a 64-bit absolute time.
  If `now` is specified, it must be a 64-bit absolute time. If it is missing,
  the current absolute time is used. The result is always within the range
  `[now + math.mininteger; now + math.maxinteger]`.

- `compare(lhs, rhs) -> integer`\
  Return -1 if the [absolute time](#absolute-time) `lhs` is before the
  [absolute time](#absolute-time) `rhs`, 1 if `lhs` is after `rhs`, and 0 if
  they are equal.

- `diff(from, to) -> integer | Int64`\
  Return the time difference from [absolute time](#absolute-time) `from` to
  [absolute time](#absolute-time) `to`. The result is positive if `from` is
  before `to`, and negative if `from` is after `to`.

- `deadline(delay) -> integer | Int64`\
  Return an [absolute time](#absolute-time) that is `delay` ticks in the future.
  `delay` is interpreted as a `uint64_t`.

- `sleep_until(time)` *[yields]*\
  Suspend the current thread until the given [absolute time](#absolute-time) is
  reached.

- `sleep_for(duration)` *[yields]*\
  Suspend the current thread for the given duration (microsecond ticks).

### Absolute time

An absolute time is a number of microseconds since an arbitrary point in time in
the past (usually the time when the system was started), measured with a
monotonic clock, and represented as a 64-bit integer.

When Lua integers are smaller than 64 bits, `Int64` is implemented as a full
userdata. This makes many operations on 64-bit integers expensive, because they
cause memory allocations. To reduce the number of allocations, most functions
taking an absolute time accept both 64-bit times and integer times. The latter
are interpreted as the low-order bits of the absolute time, while the high-order
bits are computed from the current time. This allows specifying absolute times
within 35.79 minutes of the current time (`[now + math.mininteger; now +
math.maxinteger]`) as Lua integers,

## `mlua.uf2`

**Module:** [`mlua.uf2`](../lib/common/mlua.uf2.lua),
build target: `mlua_mod_mlua.uf2`

  `reserved` and `data`.

- `serialize(block) -> string`\
  Serialize an UF2 block. `block` is a table that must contain at least
  `target_addr`, `block_no`, `num_blocks` and `data`, and optionally `flags`
  and `reserved` (default: 0).
